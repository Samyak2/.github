# Sponsor open source Rust with confidence

> An open source Rust mob programming collective
> focusing on correctness and transparency

You pay us to contribute to an open source Rust project.
We honor both your priorities and the project's existing commitments.

## When correctness is prioritized

1. Code should be written by a team of developers, synchronously,
   from the first character to the last
   — [mob programming](#mob-programming).
1. ...in the language that has the strongest guarantees
   that is still practical
   — [Rust].
1. Changes should be precise and minimal and refactors made early
   — [Razor Sharp Changes].

## Maximum transparency

All work sessions are publicly live streamed and archived.

## Mob programming

Focus on collaboration leads to better software.
Human interaction leads to happier developers.
We don't solo-program.
We [mob program][mob programming].

## Pricing

250 EUR per mob hour.

## Low risk

We contribute frequently and precisely.
If we fall short of your expectations, terminate our work.
No prior notice.

## We're not a company

We're colleagues and friends.
A collective.
We get paid via [our Open Collective].
