# Molybdenum Software

> Sponsor open source with confidence

You pay us and we contribute to open source.
We honor both your priorities and the project's existing commitments.

## In public

All work sessions are publicly live streamed and archived.

## Mob programming

Focus on collaboration leads to better software.
The smallest producing unit is therefore not a solo developer,
but a [mob][mob programming].

## Pricing

250 EUR per mob hour.

## Low risk

We contribute immediately and frequently.
If we fall short of your expectations, terminate our work without prior notice.

## Questions and answers

### I'd like to contract you for work on proprietary software

Sorry. We love open source too much.

### What languages do you support?

We're biased toward Rust and have expertise with JavaScript and TypeScript, as well.

### Show me your portfolio

We're currently looking for our first sponsor.
But here are some contributions that the founder is involved with:

- https://crates.io/crates/michie
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-standard-with-typescript

### Who are you?

Currently, this is an initiative by [Shahar "Dawn" Or], with interest from several of his peers.
