# Molybdenum Software Systems

Fully transparent open source development

## Open source

Contributing to open source feels better.
So we do only that.
We honor both the sponsor's priorities and the project's existing commitments.

## In public

All work sessions are publicly live streamed and archived.

## Mob programming

Collaboration is a primary contributing factor for quality software.
The smallest producing unit is therefore a [mob][mob programming].

## Pricing

250 EUR per hour for a mob of four developers.

## Low risk

We push to production immediately and frequently.
If we fall short of your expectations, terminate our work without prior notice.
